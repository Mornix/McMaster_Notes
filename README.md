McMaster_Notes
==============

Here I will host course summary notes for the courses I am currently taking, as a McMaster Software Engineering student, until each course has finished, when they'll be uploaded to the main website. Since they are frequently updated, it is easier to put them here than repetitively update the versions on the main website, https://sites.google.com/site/macengfifteen/

If you simply wish to view the notes, open the PDF files to reduce potential compatability issues.

If you wish to collaborate, please request to be a collaborator by sending me an e-mail at [myusername]@gmail.com

Collaborators: please also over-write the PDF versions of each file before submitting each commit

Sincerely,
goatandsheep
