##Challenges of Software Testing

* Budget pressure
 * Project planner underestimates costs of a stage
 * Estimated budget was never approved
 * Safety is required before features 
* Time pressure
 * Lower time pressure with more developers
 * Can happen if there are too many delaying factors
* Managing testing
 * Those who do testing need to be qualified
 * How to test?
     * What?
     * When?
     * How much resources?
 * Ambiguous Requirements, documentation, etc.
 * More environments
 * More languages
 * More layers

##Measurement

**Metric**: a quantitative attribute 

**Measurement**:

**Benchmark**: a standard unit of measurement 

**Measure**: to determine the measurements of something

**Symbol**: a short representation of a unit of measurement

###What to measure?

Measure everything useful to achieving your goals.

Sometimes, it can be difficult to describe an attribute using a metric, e.g. colour in nanometres.

Sometimes you want to measure something that is a combination of attributes.

###Types of measurements

**Deductive**: directly measured 

**Inductive**: determined by putting different deduced information together

##Models for testing

Often, it's not enough to simply say whether something is good or bad, so we define a model that scores it using a combination of metrics that give a quantitative score. That includes:

* Quality of Requirements
* Management issues
* Quality of work
* Productivity
* Cost
 * **Effort**: 
 * **Size**: lines of codes & function points
 * **Productivity**: 
* etc.

**Gib's Fuzzy Testing**: 

<ins>Khedri's words of wisdom</ins>: when the company at your internship is doing stuff in a non-systematic way, do what you can to change it.
